				SPACE TRAVEL
			</h1>

			<p>
				We are still many years away from deep space exploration. We still have lots of things to figure out and other things to do like explore our own solar system.The farthest distance that humans have traveled goes to the crew of Apollo 13 who were 248,655 miles away from Earth on April 14, 1970. The nearest star is four light years away which is really far and the fastest rocket ship ever created would take tens of thousands of years to make that trip. This animation above is meant to show how rocket ships are launched and what it could look like if we travel deep into space.
